        <h1>Mars and Venus are geologically active</h1>
        <h2>Mar's Results for NASA's InSight Lander</h2>
        <p>On February 24, 2020, the researchers released the intital results for 
            NASA's InSight lander on Mars. Covering the first 10 months of the
            mission, the findings have stated with the conclusion that Mars is
            seismically active. There were 174 marsquakes recorded from Febuary-
            September 2019 and the scientists were able to trace two of the
            strongest to Cerberus Fossae. Suzanne Smrekar, who is the deputy 
            principal investigator for Insight has stated that "this young region
            has undergone volcanism and other geologic changes in the last 20 million
            to 25 million years." She also stated that Mars' surface is on average
            several billion years old.

        <h2>Venus: The Second Active Planet</h2>
        <p>On July 20, 2021, a paper in Nature Geoscience added evidence that there was 
            recent volcanic activity on Venus. The researchers at ETH Zurich, led by Anna
            Gulcher, looked at the circular features called coronae, which scientists think
            form when the faults develop around areas where rising magma lifts up the surface.
            The team has concluded that at least 37 of Venus' large coronae are still evolving,
            which indiciates that it is geologically active.

        <h3>James Webb Space Telescope</h3>
        <p>The James Webb Telescope was launched by NASA in December 2021. Located 168,000 light
            -years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud, SN 1987A has been a target of intense 
            observations at wavelengths ranging from gamma rays to radio for nearly 40 years, 
            since its discovery in February of 1987.</p>
